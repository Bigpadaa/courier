Courier

Courier, the Discord Rich Presence integration for Dota 2! **Currently WIP**

Using
-----
Currently I am not distributing pre-compiled versions of Courier because I still think it's an incomplete
project and shouldn't be used in a production environment without further testing/development. But if you
really want to use it right now and you know how to use git and maven, feel free to clone the repo and build
it.

Warning about unsistanability
-----------------------------
As Valve keeps adding heroes to the game Courier is rapidly approaching it's DiscordRPC asset limit (116/150 currently)
while the title of this section sounds scary it's literally just here to warn people that if Discord doesn't raise the
limit on assets at some point we'll have to remove the feature of showing the hero icon in the RPC. (This reads like a
y2k warning but thats kinda the point)

DISCLAIMERS
-----------
This shouldn't get you VAC'd because it uses Dota 2 Game State Integration, but if you do get VAC'd I am
in noway responsible for it, don't message me about it.

Main Menu, Ranked Medal, and Hero assets all belong to Valve Software, I do not own them.

The Icon Image was made by a friend of mine who gave me permission to use it, proof: ![proof](https://i.imgur.com/EcB6knZ.png "Proof")
